user-friendly search functionality:
When a user initiates a search query, the first step is to understand the query semantically. This involves tokenizing the query into individual words, removing any common stopwords that don't add much meaning, and stemming or lemmatizing the words to reduce them to their base forms.

To retrieve relevant results, we need to compare the preprocessed query with the content of the dataset. One common method is to use techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings to measure the similarity between the query and the documents in the dataset

Once we have the similarity scores, we can rank the documents based on their relevance to the query. The documents with higher similarity scores are more likely to be relevant to the user's query. Displaying the top 3 or 5 results provides a concise and user-friendly view of the most relevant information.

To handle misspelled words, we can employ spelling correction techniques like autocorrection or using a spell-check dictionary. 

The code implementation involves leveraging natural language processing libraries like NLTK for tokenization and preprocessing. You can utilize techniques like TF-IDF for vectorization, cosine similarity for ranking, and spell correction libraries for handling misspelled words. Finally, presenting the top relevant results to the user completes the functionalit.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Load the training dataset (training_set.csv).
Understand the structure of the dataset: features, data types, distribution of target variable ('0' or '1'), missing values, etc.
Visualize data distributions, correlations, and relationships between features and the target variable.

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values: Impute missing numerical features, consider using a specific category for missing categorical features.
outlier handling by different tech

Model Selection and Training:

Choose a suitable classification algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, etc.).
Split the dataset into training and validation sets (e.g., 80-20 or 75-25 ratio).
Train the model on the training set.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Analyze the classification report to understand how well the model performs for each class.


Predictions on Test Data:

Load the test dataset (test_set.csv).
Preprocess the test data similar to the training data.
Use the trained and tuned model to predict the binary class for each record in the test dataset.
